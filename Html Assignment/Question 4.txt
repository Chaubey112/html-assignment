Q4. Write a short note on Tag and Element with an Example.

Ans - Tag - HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your web page. Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag
 More Example - <h1> </h1>, <p> </p>, <head> </head> etc
Element - Element. An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag. For example, <p> is starting tag of a paragraph and </p> is closing tag of the same paragraph but <p>This is paragraph</p> is a paragraph element.
