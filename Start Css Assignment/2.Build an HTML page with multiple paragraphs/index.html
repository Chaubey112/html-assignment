    (1). <b style="color:blue;">Block:</b>
    
    Blocks are standalone components that represent a higher-level structure in the HTML. They can be thought of as parent components.
    In CSS, block names are written in all lowercase and represent the main container of the component. For example, a navigation bar could be a block named .navbar.
          <br>

   (2). <b style="color:blue;">Element:</b>
    
    Elements are the individual parts or components within a block that cannot exist or have meaning outside of the block. They are always tied to a specific block.
    Element names are separated from the block by two underscores (__).
              <br>

   (3). <b style="color:blue;">Modifier:</b>
    
    Modifiers are used to change the appearance or behavior of a block or an element. They add variations to blocks or elements without altering their core structure.
    Modifier names are separated from the block or element by two hyphens (--). </p>
